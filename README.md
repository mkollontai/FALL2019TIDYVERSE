# CUNY DATA 607 Fall 2019 Tidyverse recipes

You have two tasks:

**Create an Example**  Using one or more TidyVerse packages, and any dataset from fivethirtyeight.com or Kaggle, create a programming sample “vignette” that demonstrates how to use one or more of the capabilities of the selected TidyVerse package with your selected dataset. (25 points)

**Extend an Existing Example**  Using one of your classmate’s examples (as created above), extend his or her example with additional annotated code. (15 points)

You should clone the provided repository.  Once you have code to submit, you should make a pull request on the shared repository.  Minimally, you should be submitted .Rmd files; ideally, you should also submit an .md file and update the README.md file with your example.

*After you’ve completed both parts of the assignment, please submit your GitHub handle name in the submission link provided in the week 1 folder!* This will let your instructor know that your work is ready to be graded.

You should complete both parts of the assignment and make your submission no later than end of day on Sunday, November 24th.

In this assignment, you’ll practice collaborating around a code project with GitHub.  You could consider our collective work as building out a book of examples on how to use TidyVerse functions.

The data selected was a Survey conducted within Europe on social values. In order to provide a simple way of visualize comparisons between these countries I showed a way to use ggplot2 to plot a world map, zoom in, and color each country accordingly.

Expanded upon work done by Joseph Simone. His work involved sorting data for airline safety. Added barplot showing the most improved and most worsened airlines in terms of fatalities.
